# ‚õìÔ∏èü™ù Chainhook

## Introduction

Blockchains serve as foundational infrastructure that unblocks new use cases and introduces a new generation of decentralized applications by relying on a public ledger.
`chainhook` is a reorg-aware transaction indexing engine that helps developers get reliable blockchain data, regardless of forks and reorgs. By focusing only on the data devs care about, Chainhook helps developers work with much lighter datasets and build IFTTT logic into their applications.
Chainhook can be used as a tool in your local development environment and as a service in the cloud environment.

Key Features:
- **Faster, More Efficient Indexing:** Instead of working with a generic blockchain indexer, taking hours to process every single transaction of every single block, developers can create their own indexes, build, iterate, and refine them in minutes. Chainhook can help developers avoid massive storage management and storage scaling issues by avoiding full chain indexation. Lighter indexes imply faster query results, which helps minimize end-user response time. This leads to an enhanced Developer Experience and an improved End-User Experience.
- **Re-org and Fork Aware:** Chainhook keeps a store of possible chain forks and checks each new chain event against the forks to maintain the current valid fork. All triggers, also known as **predicates**, are evaluated against the current valid fork. In the event of a reorg, Chainhook computes a list of new blocks to apply and old blocks to rollback and evaluates the registered predicates against those blocks.
- **IFTTT Logic, powering your applications:** Chainhook helps developers create elegant event-based architectures using triggers, also known as **predicates**. Developers can write ‚Äúif_this / then_that‚Äù **predicates**that when triggered, are packaged as events and forwarded to the configured destination. By using cloud functions as destinations, developers can also cut costs on processing by only paying for processing when a block that contains some data relevant to the developer's application is being mined.

Benefits are plurals: 
- Improved Developer + End User Experience 
- Cost Optimization for data storage management and scaling.

## Development workflow for Bitcoin chainhooks

### Guide to `if_this` / `then_that` predicate design

To get started with Bitcoin predicates, we can use the `chainhook` to generate a template: 

```bash
$ chainhook predicates new hello-ordinals.json --bitcoin
```

We will focus on the `if_this` and `then_that` parts of the specifications.

The current `bitcoin` predicates support the following `if_this` constructs:

```jsonc
// Get any transaction matching a given txid
// `txid` mandatory argument admits:
//  - 32 bytes hex encoded type. example: 
{
    "if_this": {
        "scope": "txid",
        "equals": "0xfaaac1833dc4883e7ec28f61e35b41f896c395f8d288b1a177155de2abd6052f"
    }
}

// Get any transaction, including an OP_RETURN output starting with a set of characters.

        }
    }
}

// Get any transaction including an OP_RETURN output ending with a set of characters

        "p2pkh": {
            "equals": "mr1iPkD9N3RJZZxXRk7xF9d36gffa6exNC"
        }
    }
}

// Get any transaction including a p2sh output paying a given recipient
// `p2sh` construct admits:
//  - string type. example: "2MxDJ723HBJtEMa2a9vcsns4qztxBuC8Zb2"

        "p2wpkh": {
          "equals": "bcrt1qnxknq3wqtphv7sfwy07m7e4sr6ut9yt6ed99jg"
        }

          "equals": "bc1qklpmx03a8qkv263gy8te36w0z9yafxplc5kwzc"
        }
    }

    }
}

```

In terms of actions available, the following `then_that` constructs are supported:

```jsonc
// HTTP Post block / transaction payload to a given endpoint.
// `http_post` construct admits:
//  - url (string type). Example: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/wrapBtc
//  - authorization_header (string type). Secret to add to the request `authorization` header when posting payloads
{
    "then_that": {
        "http_post": {
            "url": "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/wrapBtc",
            "authorization_header": "Bearer cn389ncoiwuencr"
        }
    }
}

// Append events to a file through the filesystem. Convenient for local tests.
// `file_append` construct admits:
//  - path (string type). Path to file on disk.
{
    "then_that": {
        "file_append": {
            "path": "/tmp/events.json",
        }
    }

### Guide to local Bitcoin testnet / mainnet predicate scanning

In order to scan the Bitcoin chain with a given predicate, a `bitcoind` instance with access to the RPC methods `getblockhash` and `getblock` must be accessible. The RPC calls latency will directly impact the speed of the scans.

*Note: the configuration of a `bitcoind` instance is out of scope for this guide.*

Assuming a `bitcoind` node correctly configured, scans can be performed using the following command:
```bash
$ chainhook predicates scan ./path/to/predicate.json --testnet
```
When using the flag `--testnet`, the scan operation will generate a configuration file in memory using the following settings:
```toml
[storage]
working_dir = "cache" # Directory used by chainhook node for caching data

[network]
mode = "testnet"
bitcoind_rpc_url = "http://0.0.0.0:18332"
bitcoind_rpc_username = "bitcoind_username"
bitcoind_rpc_password = "bitcoind_password"
# bitcoind_zmq_url = "tcp://0.0.0.0:18543"

[limits]
max_number_of_bitcoin_predicates = 100
max_number_of_concurrent_bitcoin_scans = 100
max_number_of_stacks_predicates = 10
max_number_of_concurrent_stacks_scans = 10
max_number_of_processing_threads = 16
max_number_of_networking_threads = 16
max_caching_memory_size_mb = 32000
```

When using the flag `--mainnet`, the scan operation will generate a configuration file in memory using the following settings:
```toml
[storage]
working_dir = "cache"

[network]
mode = "testnet"
bitcoind_rpc_url = "http://0.0.0.0:8332"
bitcoind_rpc_username = "bitcoind_username"
bitcoind_rpc_password = "bitcoind_password"
# bitcoind_zmq_url = "tcp://0.0.0.0:18543"

[limits]
max_number_of_bitcoin_predicates = 100
max_number_of_concurrent_bitcoin_scans = 100
max_number_of_stacks_predicates = 10
max_number_of_concurrent_stacks_scans = 10
max_number_of_processing_threads = 16
max_number_of_networking_threads = 16
max_caching_memory_size_mb = 32000
```

By passing the flag `--config=/path/to/config.toml`, developers can customize the credentials and network address of their Bitcoin node. 
```bash
$ chainhook config new --testnet
‚úî Generated config file Chainhook.toml

$ chainhook predicates scan ./path/predicate.json --config-path=./Testnet.toml
```

**Tips and tricks**

To optimize their experience with scanning, developers have a few knobs they can play with:

- Use of adequate values for `start_block` and `end_block` in predicates will drastically improve the speed.
- Networking: reducing the number of network hops between the chainhook process and the bitcoind process can also help a lot.

### Guide to local Stacks testnet / mainnet predicate scanning

Developers can test their Stacks predicates without spinning up a Stacks node.
To date, the Stacks blockchain has just over 2 years of activity, and the `chainhook` utility is able to work with both `testnet` and `mainnet` chainstates, in memory.  

To test a Stacks `if_this` / `then_that` predicate, the following command can by used:

```bash
$ chainhook predicates scan ./path/to/predicate.json  --testnet
```

The first time this command run, a chainstate archive will be downloaded, uncompressed, and written to disk (around 3GB required for the testnet, 10GB for the mainnet).

The subsequent scans will use the cached chainstate if already present, speeding up iterations and the overall feedback loop. 

---
## Run `chainhook` as a service for streaming new blocks

`chainhook` can be run as a background service for streaming and processing new canonical blocks appended to the Bitcoin and Stacks blockchains.

When running chainhook as a service, `if_this` / `then_that` predicates can be registered by passing the path of the `json` file in the command line: 

```bash
$ chainhook service start --predicate-path=./path/to/predicate-1.json --predicate-path=./path/to/predicate-2.json --config-path=./path/to/config.toml
```

Predicates can also be added dynamically. When the `--predicate-path` option is not passed or when the `--start-http-api` option is passed, `chainhook` will instantiate a REST API allowing developers to list, add, and removes predicates at runtime:

```bash
$ chainhook service start --config-path=./path/to/config.toml
```

```bash
$ chainhook service start --predicate-path=./path/to/predicate-1.json --start-http-api --config-path=./path/to/config.toml
```

A comprehensive OpenAPI specification explaining how to interact with the Chainhook REST API can be found [here](./docs/chainhook-openapi.json).
